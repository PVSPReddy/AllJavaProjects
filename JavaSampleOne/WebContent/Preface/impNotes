NOTE:
JDBCFilter & CookieFilter have the same  url-pattern =/*, 
you must be configured to ensure that JDBCFilter  is  executed first. 
Therefore, you need to declare the order in web.xml (There is no way to declare the order by Annotation).
for this check "web.xml" file.



eg.:

Some JSP pages will be used to embed into other JSP page at Runtime, through the use of:
<jsp:include page="_header.jsp"></jsp:include>
<jsp:include page="_menu.jsp"></jsp:include>
<jsp:include page="_footer.jsp"></jsp:include>


17 Home Page
When entering the default path, 
eg enter the site's domain name it will display the home page (Case contextPath = ""), 
you need to declare your home page in <welcome-file-list> of web.xml

Link below is showing the content of the page index.html

http://localhost:8081/SimpleWebApp/
You need to design a home page as a JSP page to display dynamic information instead of a html page that contains static information.

in "web.xml" add home
<welcome-file-list>
 
   <welcome-file>home</welcome-file>
    
   <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
    
</welcome-file-list>
